  <h1>floatigans</h1>
  <p><em>A water-touring project by passionate paddlers.</em></p>
  <div class="bio">
    Not so long ago — roughly a few compiles back —  
    I was building apps on quantum computers, where qubits decided for us what would be zero, one, or perhaps a *transzistent decoherence system of the von-Scharfenkreutz type*.  
    I worked on deep learning servers — deeper than Loch Ness, and just as temperamental.  
    <br/>
    And now… I set sail with the *Floatigans*, paddling through the dreamscapes of Google Maps and hyperdimensional tensors.  
    **Our mission is adventure — to rediscover the beauty of this planet, which so often slips past us in the monotony of working hours.**  
    We row with code-paddles: Folium, Geemap, and a splash of JavaScript — powered by curiosity and coffee brewed hotter than a throttled CPU.  
    <br/>
    Follow our wake across the waves — or at least, drop a star on GitHub. 🌟🗺️

  <p>🚧 <strong>Under construction</strong🚧</p>
  <p>This river-born adventure is just getting started. We’re charting the waters, tuning up the gear, and building something worth paddling for. Stay tuned — the Floatigans will be floating soon!</p>
