# floatigans
_A water-touring project by passionate paddlers._
<br/>
> Not so long ago — roughly a few compiles back —  
> I was building apps on quantum computers, where qubits decided for us what would be zero, one, or perhaps a *transzistent decoherence system of the von-Scharfenkreutz type*.  
> I worked on deep learning servers — deeper than Loch Ness, and just as temperamental.  
>  
> And now… I set sail with the *Floatigans*, paddling through the dreamscapes of Google Maps and hyperdimensional tensors.  
> **Our mission is adventure — to rediscover the beauty of this planet, which so often slips past us in the monotony of working hours.**  
> We row with code-paddles: Folium, Geemap, and a splash of JavaScript — powered by curiosity and coffee brewed hotter than a throttled CPU.  
>  
> Follow our wake across the waves — or at least, drop a star on GitHub. 🌟🗺️

This river-born adventure is just getting started. We’re charting the waters, tuning up the gear, and building something worth paddling for. Stay tuned — the Floatigans will be floating soon!
