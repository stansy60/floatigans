# ![Whale]([images/small-whale.png](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb9a5163-ad47-466c-8213-5037f52cc42f) San River 2025 – Kayaking Route

This project aims to demonstrate how, with minimal effort, a simple set of dependencies, and a clean file structure, it's possible to create a clear, functional, and visually pleasant map — suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.

The project demonstrates:

- the use of the Folium library to generate HTML-based maps,
- techniques for isolating and reusing fragments of HTML and JavaScript code ("code snipping"),
- a minimalist approach to building interactive map pages without relying on frontend frameworks.

This project shows that even with a small set of dependencies and a simple file structure, it's possible to create a clear, functional, and visually pleasant map — suitable for both desktop and mobile devices.
